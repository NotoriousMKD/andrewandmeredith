## When & Where

### Location

The **entire event** â€”Â ceremony, cocktails, dinner, and dancing â€”Â will be held at one of our favorite spots in Boston, [Alden & Harlow](http://www.aldenharlow.com). It's cozy and intimate with a whole lot of character, and the food and drinks will knock your socks off.

### Schedule

We'll be celebrating together from **6:00 PM to 11:30 PM**, and here's a rough idea of what to expect:

**6:00 PM | Arrival.** Guests arrive to champagne glasses and give each other hearty hellos and hugs.

**6:30 PM | Ceremony.** Andrew & Meredith say "I do" (and a few other cute things).

**7:00 PM | Cocktail Hour.** Everyone celebrates by mingling over some cocktails and appetizers.

**8:00 PM | Dinner.** Mingling continues and dinner fare materializes, buffet style (seating for everyone, but nothing assigned). Some lovely people will make lovely toasts. Maybe a ceremonial dance or two featuring the newlyweds.

**9:30 PM | Dancing.** Partayyyyyy tiiiiiime. Let's dance. No Macarena and no slow songs (no offense). Only 100% party jams. Don't forget to visit the photo booth!

**11:00 PM | Last call.** You came. You loved. You partied.

**11:30 PM | Goodbyes.** Noooooo don't leave us ðŸ˜­

## Transportation

### Iconic Boston Trolley

If youâ€™ve spent any time walking around Boston, youâ€™ve seen [Old Town Trolley Tours'](https://www.trolleytours.com/boston) green and orange trolleys roaming the streets. We'll be providing two trolleys to shuttle guests to and from both of our wedding block hotels, Le MÃ©ridien and The Marriott Cambridge, to Alden & Harlow on the wedding day.

The trolley service will start at 5:00 PM and the last trolley will leave Alden & Harlow at 11:30 PM. So feel free to hop on and off anytime throughout the evening.

### Rideshare

If getting your own transportation is a better fit for you, both hotels are about 15 min away by Uber/Lyft, even on a busy summer night.

### Walking

If you end up at The Charles Hotel or the Sheraton Commander you'll be walking distance, only about 2 blocks away.

### Driving

If you're driving in, we would recommend using the parking garage nearby. Trying to find street parking near the restaurant will be basically impossible, but let us know [when you RSVP](https://forms.gle/oGE2CyvYXqrC5PDH9) and we'll be happy to snag you a free parking pass for the evening.

## The Vibe

### Attire

The ceremony will be partially seated and the dinner will be mingle-y, so you will likely be standing more than you would at a typical wedding. It's probably not the right night for your highest stilettos. Wear something fun! If you're looking for a little more direction, we'd recommend a "fancy date night" type of outfit. Anything more formal than jeans and less formal than a tuxedo is perfect.

  <summary>Morphsuits are highly encouraged.</summary>

### Menu

We haven't finalized a menu yet, but as soon as we do we'll share it here. We promise it will taste good! There should be something for everyone â€” vegetarians and vegans, meat lovers, seafood fanatics, gluten averse... If you're concerned about dietary restrictions, please let us know [when you RSVP](https://forms.gle/oGE2CyvYXqrC5PDH9)!

## Kids

We love you and your offspring, and you are absolutely welcome to bring kids to the wedding! It seems to us like there isn't a ton of space in this setting for having fun if you're a kid, but maybe it's super fun for kids to go to a wedding? We don't know because we are child-less and bewildered/amazed by parenting. We are happy to answer any specific questions you may have that would help you decide if you will bring your kids or not.
