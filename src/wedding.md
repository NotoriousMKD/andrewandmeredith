## When & Where

### Location

The **entire event** ‚Äî¬†ceremony, cocktails, dinner, and dancing ‚Äî¬†will be held at one of our favorite spots in Boston, [Alden & Harlow](http://www.aldenharlow.com). It's cozy and intimate with a whole lot of character, and the food and drinks will knock your socks off.

### Schedule

We'll be celebrating together from **6:00 PM to 11:00 PM**, and here's a rough idea of what to expect:

**6:00 PM | Arrival.** Guests arrive to champagne glasses and give each other hearty hellos and hugs.

**6:30 PM | Ceremony.** Andrew & Meredith say "I do" (and a few other cute things).

**7:00 PM | Cocktail Hour.** Everyone celebrates by mingling over some cocktails and appetizers.

**8:00 PM | Dinner.** Mingling continues and dinner fare materializes, buffet style (seating for everyone, but nothing assigned). Some lovely people will make lovely toasts. Maybe a ceremonial dance or two featuring the newlyweds.

**9:00 PM | Dancing.** Partayyyyyy tiiiiiime. Let's dance. No Macarena and no slow songs (no offense). Only 100% party jams. Don't forget to stop by the photo booth!

**11:00 PM | Goodbyes.** Late night snacks and some bittersweet goodbyes.

## Transportation

### Iconic Boston Trolley

If you‚Äôve spent any time walking around Boston, you‚Äôve seen [Old Town Trolley Tours'](https://www.trolleytours.com/boston) green and orange trolleys roaming the streets. We'll be providing a trolley to shuttle guests to and from either of our wedding block hotels, Le M√©ridien and The Marriott Cambridge, to the restaurant on the wedding day. More details TBA soon!

### Rideshare

If getting your own transportation is a better fit for you, both hotels are 10-15 min away by Uber/Lyft, even on a busy summer night.

### Walking

If you end up at The Charles Hotel or the Sheraton Commander you'll be walking distance, only about 2 blocks away.

### Driving

If you're driving in, we would recommend using the parking garage nearby. Trying to find street parking in Boston will be basically impossible, but there are tons of other parking garages around Boston if you want to look elsewhere. Let us know [when you RSVP](https://forms.gle/oGE2CyvYXqrC5PDH9) and we'll be happy to snag you a free parking pass for the evening.

## The Vibe

### Attire

The ceremony will be partially seated and the dinner will be mingle-y, so you will likely be standing more than you would at a typical wedding. It's probably not the right night for your highest stilettos. Wear something fun!

If you're looking for a little more direction, we'd recommend a "fancy date night" type of outfit. Anything more formal than jeans and less formal than a tuxedo is perfect. [Morphsuits](https://photos.app.goo.gl/g9kn5sFx2xW5HPpD7) are highly encouraged.

### Menu

We haven't finalized a menu yet, but as soon as we do we'll share it here. We promise it will taste good!

There should be something for everyone ‚Äî vegetarians and vegans, meat lovers, seafood fanatics, gluten averse... If you're concerned about dietary restrictions, please let us know [when you RSVP](https://forms.gle/oGE2CyvYXqrC5PDH9)!

## Kids

We love you and your offspring, and you are absolutely welcome to bring kids to the wedding! It seems to us like there isn't a ton of space in this setting for having fun if you're a kid, but maybe it's super fun for kids to go to a wedding? We don't know because we are child-less and bewildered/amazed by parenting. We are happy to answer any specific questions you may have that would help you decide if you will bring your kids or not.

If you need special food accommodations (e.g. the kids would prefer chicken nuggets to chicken torchon), Alden & Harlow is prepared and happy to help.
