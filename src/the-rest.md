Your presence is gift enough! Seriously.

But if you'd like to get something for us, we've made it a little easier with this online registry (*coming soon!*).

## Boston: Points of Interest

We made you this handy map! It's got all the major locations related to our wedding weekend, so you can see them all in one place. And we've also added recommendations for local places to eat, attractions to visit, and other things you might want to do while you're in town.

You can also [view the map full-screen](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1YViXbcdejBdYPMC9Q-rSpbtDueOqHOS2&hl=en&usp=sharing).
