## Gifts

### The Registry

<a href="https://www.zola.com/registry/andrew-and-meredith">🎁 View Our Wedding Registry</a>

### Preface

- **We added personal notes to every single gift.** You can click on a preview thumbnail of the item to view more details, including why we'd love to have it and how we plan to use it. Plus there are some fun and entertaining anecdotes in there, too.
- **We just bought a house!** So lots of our requests are home-related, or based in Yellow Springs, OH, where we're moving.
- **We'd love used versions of most of these gifts**. We like to shop on Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace, to give used stuff a new home. But we also don't want you to spend a ton of energy sourcing secondhand gifts. Either option is wonderful and will be greatly appreciated!
- **We love supporting local businesses.** If you can't find an item secondhand, buying it locally from a small business is also wonderful, and of course totally optional.
- **Zola.com let's you [price match](https://www.zola.com/wedding-registry/benefits/price-match) gifts.** This comes with [some caveats](https://help.zola.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002839891-What-is-a-qualifying-product-for-price-matching-), but if you find an item elsewhere online that's cheaper than in our registry, you can email [support@zola.com](mailto:support@zola.com) to ask about matching the price.
