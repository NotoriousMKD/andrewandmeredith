On July 18, 2020 Andrew & Meredith are getting married at [Alden & Harlow](http://www.aldenharlow.com/) in Boston, MA. It will be awesome.

Meredith is an educational technologist at MIT, and Andrew is a software developer at WeSpire, where the two of them first met. 4 years later Andrew donned a red spandex full-body suit and popped out of a giant gift box to propose. Wedding, voila!
