## Where to Stay

### Wedding Block Hotels

For our guests' convenience, we have secured two different discounted hotel options near our wedding venue, under the “Davies/Borstein Wedding Room Block”.

### Airbnb

There are lots of options nearby! Our favorite squares (aka neighborhoods in Boston-speak) are Inman, Union, Davis, Central, Kendall, and Harvard. If you want to venture a little further, Beacon Hill, South Boston, and Brookline are also very nice.

## How to Get Here

### By Plane

Did you know you can reach Boston by airplane? Crazy, right?? Grab yourself a flight to [Logan International Airport](http://www.massport.com/logan-airport/) and you can avoid all the hassle of having to pahk yah cah neayah Havahd Yahd.

### By Train or Bus

Trains are awesome! And buses are totally fine! Whichever you fancy, you'll want to arrive at [South Station](https://www.south-station.net/) in downtown Boston.

### By Car

First, make sure you have access to a car and it has gas in it. Then enter "Boston" into the Google Maps app on your smartphone and press "Navigate". Are you there yet?

## How to Get Around

### Rideshare

Uber and Lyft are everywhere and very convenient, like any major city. We find that an average ride within Boston costs about $10 - $20.

### Subway

If you're feeling adventurous and thrifty the [MBTA](https://www.mbta.com/schedules/subway) is also a great option. We recommend a day pass for open-ended exploring.

### Walking & Biking

Boston is a relatively small city in terms of square mileage — it's easy to walk pretty much anywhere, and there are plenty of city bikes (and bike lanes!) available, too.
