### Airbnb

There are lots of options nearby! Our favorite squares (aka neighborhoods in Boston-speak) are Inman, Union, Davis, Central, Kendall, and Harvard. If you want to venture a little further, Beacon Hill, South Boston, and Brookline are also very nice.

## How to Get Here

### By Plane

Did you know you can reach Boston by airplane? Crazy, right?? Grab yourself a flight to [Logan International Airport](http://www.massport.com/logan-airport/) and you can avoid all the hassle of having to pahk yah cah neayah Havahd Yahd.

Once you're off the plane, you can take the Silver Line (a bus) from the aiport into Boston for free. The SL1 bus picks up and drops off at every Logan Airport terminal. You can hop on the bus for free, and get off the bus at South Station in downtown Boston. To continue on to the hotels, make your way to the Inbound Red Line (a train) towards Alewife.

If you're staying at the Boston Marriott Cambridge, you'll get off the train at the Kendall/MIT stop which is [right next to the hotel](https://goo.gl/maps/KfjHLYKBpa9uBSAo9). 

If you're staying at Le Meridien, you'll get off the train at the Central stop and [walk about 6 minutes to the hotel](https://goo.gl/maps/4Hn8cKPzn9HcYutt8).


### By Train or Bus

Trains are awesome! And buses are totally fine! Whichever you fancy, you'll want to arrive at [South Station](https://www.south-station.net/) in downtown Boston.

### By Car

First, make sure you have access to a car and it has gas in it. Then enter "Boston" into the Google Maps app on your smartphone and press "Navigate". Are you there yet?

## How to Get Around

### Rideshare

Uber and Lyft are everywhere and very convenient, like any major city. We find that an average ride within Boston costs about $10 - $20.

### Subway

If you're feeling adventurous and thrifty the [MBTA](https://www.mbta.com/schedules/subway) is also a great option. We recommend a day pass for open-ended exploring.

### Walking & Biking

Boston is a relatively small city in terms of square mileage — it's easy to walk pretty much anywhere, and there are plenty of city bikes (and bike lanes!) available, too.
