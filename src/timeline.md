## Saturday

### üíç Wedding @ Alden & Harlow

Did you hear we're getting married? We built a website about it and everything. Join us on **Nov. 5th @ 6:00 PM ‚Äì 11:00 PM** at [Alden & Harlow](http://www.aldenharlow.com) to see what all the fuss is about (view [the wedding page](/wedding/) for more details).

        "description": "[h2]Location[/h2]The [strong]entire event[/strong] ‚Äì¬†ceremony, cocktails, dinner, and dancing ‚Äî¬†will be held at one of our favorite restaurants in Boston, [url]http://www.aldenharlow.com|Alden & Harlow[/url]. It's a cozy spot with a whole lot of character. And lucky for us, we'll have the whole place to ourselves.\n\n[h2]Schedule[/h2]We'll be celebrating together from [strong]6:00 PM ‚Äì 11:00 PM[/strong], and here's a rough idea of what to expect:\n\n[strong]6:00 PM | Arrival[/strong]\n. Guests arrive to champagne glasses and give each other hearty hellos and hugs.\n\n[strong]6:30 PM | Ceremony[/strong]\n. Andrew and Meredith say 'I do' (and a few other cute things).\n\n[strong]7:00 PM | Cocktail Hour[/strong]\n. Everyone celebrates by mingling over some cocktails and appetizers.\n\n[strong]8:00 PM | Dinner[/strong]\n. Mingling continues and dinner fare materializes, buffet style (seating for everyone, but nothing assigned). Some lovely people will make lovely toasts. Maybe a ceremonial dance or two featuring the newlyweds.\n\n[strong]9:00 PM | Dancing[/strong]\n. Partayyyyyy tiiiiiime. Let's dance. No Macarena and no slow songs (no offense). Only 100% party jams. Don't forget to stop by the photo booth!\n\n[strong]11:00 PM | Goodbyes[/strong]\n. Late night snacks and some bittersweet goodbyes.",
