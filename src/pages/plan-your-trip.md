## How to Get Here

### By Plane

Did you know you can reach Boston by airplane? Crazy, right?? Grab yourself a flight to [Logan International Airport](http://www.massport.com/logan-airport/) and you can avoid all the hassle of having to pahk yah cah neayah Havahd Yahd.

### By Train or Bus

Trains are awesome! And buses are totally fine! Whichever you fancy, you'll want to arrive at [South Station](https://www.south-station.net/) in downtown Boston. 

### By Car

First, make sure you have access to a car and it has gas in it. Then enter "Boston" into the Google Maps app on your smartphone and press "Navigate". Are you there yet?

## Where to Stay

### Hotels

For our guests' convenience, we have secured 3 different hotel blocks near our wedding venue:

* [The Charles Hotel](https://goo.gl/maps/h4Y6Hsb5WNZ6CJQ56) - $309 | Harvard Square (0.25 mi)
* [Le Meridien](https://goo.gl/maps/Bs52XamKjugYJxyU6) - $209 | Central Square (1 mi)
* [The Marriott](https://goo.gl/maps/KJxcu23ywJZvkWKc7) - $179 | Kendall Square (2 mi)

### Airbnb

There are lots of options nearby! Our favorite squares (aka neighborhoods in Boston-speak) are Inman, Union, Davis, Central, Kendall, and Harvard. If you want to venture a little further, Beacon Hill, South Boston, and Brookline are also very nice.

## How to Get Around

### Rideshare

Uber and Lyft are everywhere and very convenient, like any major city. We find that an average ride within Boston costs about $7 - $14.

### Subway

If you're feeling adventurous and thrifty, the MBTA subway is also a convenient option. We recommend a day pass or weekend pass if you want to give that a shot.

### Walking & Biking

Boston is a relatively tiny city â€” it's easy to walk pretty much anywhere, and there are plenty of city bikes (and bike lines!) available, too.
