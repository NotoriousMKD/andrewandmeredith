## Location

Imagine for a second that you're at an awesome party, at a lively, local spot, with amazing food and drinks, where the two hosts just happen to be getting married... well imagine no more! Because that's what you're in store for on July 18th in Boston. 

The **entire event** — ceremony, cocktails, dinner, and dancing — will be held at one of our favorite restaurants in Boston, [Alden & Harlow](http://www.aldenharlow.com/). It's an intimate and cozy spot with a whole lot of character. And lucky for us, we'll have the whole place to ourselves.

## Transportation

If you're staying nearby, the easiest way to get here is Uber/Lyft. The Marriott in Kendall Square and Le Meridian in Crental Square are both 10-15 min away by car, even on a busy summer night. If you end up at The Charles hotel you'll be walking distance, only a 2 blocks away.

If you're driving in, we would recommend using the parking garage nearby. Trying to find street parking in Boston will be basically impossible, but there are tons of other parking garages around Boston if you want to look elsewhere. 

## Attire

Everybody get nekkid

## Menu

We don't want to build up too much hype but... we sinerely believe that you will have the best food and drinks you have **ever** had at a wedding. Like the type you would eat on a fancy date night, but it's all free, all night. 

There will be food for every type of preferences and diet — vegetarians and vegans, meat lovers, seefood fanatics, gluten no-thank-you-ers, homemade butter afficionados. And if that's not enough, the wonderfully creative kitchen staff can help us figure something out. 

## Kids

We love kids! We don't have any of our own yet, but you are absolutely weclome to bring yours. There won't be any kid-oriented activities, per se, except for dancing! The entire party will take place in one cozy and romantically lit space.  

If you need special food accommodations (e.g. the kids would prefer chicken nuggets to chicken torchon), Alden & Harlow is prepared and happy to help.

## Schedule

We'll be celebrating together from **6:00 PM to 12:00 AM**, and here's a rough idea of what to expect:

### 6:00 PM - Arrival

Guests arrive and give each other hearty hellos and hugs

### 6:30 PM - Ceremony

Andrew & Meredith say I do (and a few other cute things)

### 7:00 PM - Cocktail Hour

Everyone celebrates by mingling over some cocktails and appetizers

### 8:00 PM - Dinner

Mingling continues and dinner fare materializes, buffet style. Some lovely people will make lovely toasts. Maybe a ceremonial dance or two featuring the newlyweds. Who knows! 

### 9:00 PM - Dancing

Partayyyyyy tiiiiiime. Let's dance. No cha-cha slide and no slow slongs (no offense). Only 100% party jams. Also a good time for a pee break. Don't forget to stop by the photo booth!

### 11:00 PM - Wind Down

Late night snacks and dessert. Some bittersweet goodbyes. 

### 12:00 AM - TBD

After the party it's the afterparty.
